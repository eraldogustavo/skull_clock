<h1>Reliant Code Challenge</h1>

<h2>School, a.k.a. 💀️</h2>

<p>An important part of the 💀️ platform is to allow teachers to clock-in/clock-out of their
school center. When a teacher arrives at work, they clock-in, when they leave they clock-out,
and the platform keeps track of these events.</p>

<p>Using this Ruby on Rails project, build an MVP of a timesheet application.</p>

<p>Your submission should meet the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A user should be able to click a "Clock In" button to begin tracking time.</li>
  <li>A user should be able to click a "Clock Out" button to stop tracking time.</li>
  <li>A user should see a list of all their time entries.</li>
  <li>A user should see be able to export all their clockin/clockout results in a single CSV.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some things to note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A teacher will need to clock in and out multiple times a day (e.g., for lunch)</li>
  <li>Time entries will need to be editable.</li>
  <li>Time edits must be auditable, i.e. must be possible to see the edit history of an Clock entry.</li>
  <li>The application should support many users.</li>
  <li>Are there any validations the application should do? If so, how should it display errors to
    users?</li>
  <li>Testing is an important part of our workflow at 💀️, consider including tests for at
    least one part of the application. No need to add tests for everything</li>
</ul>

<h2>What we want to check with this simple test?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Basic understanding of coesion and coupling in programming.</li>
  <li>Basic organization
    <ul>
      <li>How do you organize the git commits</li>
      <li>Add any additional instructions needed in the README.md file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Write tests just one part of the application, but don't forget to tell us what part did you test!
    <ul>
      <li>At Reliant we use rspec for testing, but in this test you can be written in any ruby test framework, rspec, minitest, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What we DON'T want to check with this simple test?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>UI appearance, if you make it look good, ok, if not, no problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to send the result</h2>

<p>Be sure you saved your work in beautiful git commits then do:</p>

<pre><code>git clean -dfx
cd ..
tar -cpvf yourname.tar.gz skull/
</code></pre>

Then send the tar.gz to by email to <a href="mailto:tmenezes@reliant.io">Talita</a>.
